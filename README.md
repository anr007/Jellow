# Jellow 

[Jellow Communicator](http://jellow.org/) is a friendly Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app that uses icons/images to enable speech. This freely downloadable Android app can be used for communication by those learning to speak or those having difficulty with speech. Jellow can also be used by toddlers and early learners to learn words and categories frequently used in their daily lives. Jellowâ€™s colourful and friendly icons can help children develop an association between pictures and their corresponding word labels.
                                                          
Jellow has a simple, visually appealing and easy-to-learn interface consisting central 'category' buttons and 'expressive' side buttons. The content of the app is organized into basic category buttons that make it easy for the user to access and find desired icons. The user can make the app speak out sentences by simply clicking on any of the category buttons followed by any of the expressive buttons. 
                                                          
Jellow has over 1000 icons and over 10000 lines of pre-programmed text. In addition, using the 'keyboard' feature, the user can also generate new sentences and use the app to speak them out aloud. The current version of the app allows the user to choose from 3 languages  (English, Hindi, Bengali and Marathi) and multiple accents (Indian, American, British). 
                                                          
Jellow is developed at the IDC School of Design at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) located in Mumbai. The application is still under development. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please submit your feedback/comments via email at jellowcommunicator@gmail.com or dsource.in@gmail.com.
